# 👁️ Ocularis AI

> Real-time Eye Health & Fatigue Monitoring Dashboard built with React + Vite.

Ocularis AI is a modern web-based analytics dashboard that tracks and visualizes eye activity metrics such as blink rate, fatigue score, ambient lighting, and screen distance.  
It is designed to promote healthier screen usage habits through real-time feedback and intelligent scoring.

## 🧠 Core Logic Overview

### Blink Detection
Utility functions calculate blink frequency trends over time.

### Fatigue Score
Custom scoring algorithm combining:
- Blink rate patterns
- Time spent on screen
- Behavioral thresholds

### Distance Monitoring
Estimates approximate face-to-screen distance for posture awareness.

### Light Analysis
Evaluates ambient lighting conditions to reduce eye strain risk.
